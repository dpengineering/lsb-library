**Getting Started**

First, navigate to the Class Examples folder. Then, navigate to the programming folder. There should be a folder in there called YourName_LuminismShadowBox. Copy that to your desktop.

Open up the copied folder and double click on the file called 'YourName_LuminismShadowBox.ino'. This should open up the Arduino IDE. Now, you're ready to get started. You can start writing your code in the ```code()``` function. ***DO NOT*** alter the contents of ANY other function in the program unless strictly instructed to do so.
